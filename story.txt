On an Island far away, there were four ronin.One of them was black.
They had no employment, no masters, no future.
That was until they heard about a Daimy≈ç was employing soldiers in the land of Yup.
After traveling days in the grueling jungle, battling wild beasts. They find a small run-down temple.
As they make their way to the temple a shadow theives their weapons leaving them defenseless. Soon they 
are surronded by thousands of shadows. Defenseless and on the verge of dying. A sharp wind rushes through
the ronin and all the shadows instantly get obliterated. Suddenly they hear a voice behind them saying 
"Who are you"
