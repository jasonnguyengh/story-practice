On an Island far away, there were four ronin. One of them was black.
They had no employment, no masters, no future.
That was until they heard about a Daimyō was employing soldiers in the land of Yup.
After traveling days in the grueling jungle, battling wild beasts. They find a small run-down temple.
As they make their way to the temple a shadow thieves their weapons leaving them defenseless. Soon they 
are surronded by thousands of shadows. Defenseless and on the verge of dying. A sharp wind rushes through
the ronin and all the shadows instantly get obliterated. Suddenly they hear a voice behind them saying 
"Who are you?"
The four ronin turn around, ready to strike, even without their weapons. An older man appears. He seems to be blind. Anki quickly strikes a punch but with no effect.
The punch went right through the man. Astonished, the four ronin retreat back. 
"I should ask you who you are!" said Anki.
The old man replies "I was once alive, but no longer." said the man. "Now again, I ask, Who are you? What brings you here?"
"We are four ronin traveling from the four corners of the world. We got lost trying to find our way to the Daimyō of the land of Yup" said Jinji.
The old man replies "I will show you the way, but first I must test you all to see if you can survive. The samurai of this land are fierce and merciless, you will not survive if you cannot pass this test."
With a snap of his fingers, the old man brings out a tea pot and let's the ronin rest before their test.
In their sleep, the ronin are brought outside to the top of a mountain with a huge forest below,near the temple. As they wake up startled they hear the old man say "Make it back to the temple alive before the sun rises and I will take you to the Daimyō of the Land of Yup" and he disappeared.
