On an Island far away, there were four ronin.One of them was black.
They had no employment, no masters, no future.
That was until they heard about a Daimy≈ç was employing soldiers in the land of Yup.
After traveling days in the grueling jungle, battling wild beasts. They find a small run-down temple.
As they make their way to the temple a shadow theives their weapons leaving them defenseless. Soon they 
are surronded by thousands of shadows. Defenseless and on the verge of dying. A sharp wind rushes through
the ronin and all the shadows instantly get obliterated. Suddenly they hear a voice behind them saying 
"Who are you?"
The four ronin turn around, ready to strike, even without their weapons. An older man appears. He seems to be blind. Anki quickly strikes a punch but with no effect.
The punch went right through the man. Astonished, the four ronin retreat back and state who they are.
"I should ask you who you are!" said Anki.
The old man replies "I was once alive, but no longer." said the man. "Now again, I ask, Who are you? What brings you here?"
